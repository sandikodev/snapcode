# 🎓 A 10-Year Journey in Computer Science

## 💫 Dedication

**This project is a celebration of 10 years (2016-2026) in Computer Science, specializing in Web Technology.**

A journey of passion, mistakes, hard lessons, and unwavering love for the craft—despite all obstacles.

---

## 🎯 The Real Journey

### Early Years: The Foundation

**Childhood - Balita**
- Fascinated by computers and assembly
- Built first PC in 2nd grade (SD Kelas 2)
- Intel Pentium 2 with iconic slot RAM
- The spark that started everything

**SMP (Junior High)**
- Active in scientific writing
- Research: Eco-friendly energy (Ethanol gas from tofu waste fermentation)
- Robotics: Automatic door with simple circuits (no microcontroller)
- Wild ideas and endless curiosity

---

### The First Big Mistake: Wrong Decision

**SMA Negeri 3 Bantul - IPS (Social Sciences)**

**Why IPS?**
- Not my own decision
- Advice: "Career as a trader"
- Thought: "Learn economics"
- Reality: **Wrong path**

**The Realization (Quarter semester in)**
- Felt completely wrong
- Far from vision: researcher, system designer, developer
- Impulsive brain screaming to switch

**Requested: Switch to IPA (Natural Sciences)**
- Approved
- But... toxic senior culture
- Ego couldn't handle it
- Motivation collapsed

**The Dropout #1**
- Stopped school
- Mental breakdown
- Late realization: Only 2 years left
- Ego: "Can't fall behind friends"
- Reality: Already behind

**The Shame**
- Couldn't face friends
- Ego shattered
- Had to transfer schools
- Had to repeat the year
- Forced to make a REAL decision

---

### 2016: The Real Beginning

**SMK Negeri 3 Yogyakarta**  
*Teknik Komputer Jaringan (Computer Network Engineering)*

**Why Vocational?**
- Aligned with lifelong passion
- Technical skills I already mastered
- A decision I could stand by
- A path to financial independence

Learning:
- Network infrastructure
- System administration
- Hardware & software
- The foundation of IT

**Finally, the right path.**

---

### 2021: The Second Big Mistake

**The Dilemma: Two Universities**

**Amikom Yogyakarta**
- My choice
- Aligned with my skills
- Problem: Expensive (suffocating cost)

**UIN Sunan Kalijaga**
- Parents' suggestion
- Not my choice
- Not aligned with my skills
- Advantage: Affordable

**The Overconfident Decision**
- "I can do both!"
- Salary: 2M IDR/month (UMR Jogja)
- Calculation: 12M/semester can cover both (8M total)
- **Fatal miscalculation**

---

### The Brutal Reality

**2021: Office Expansion**
- From IT Support to Software House
- Company in startup phase
- Terrible ecosystem
- Horrible operational management

**2022: Complete Collapse**
- Company bankrupt
- Boss: Womanizer, bad cashflow management
- Corrupt, undisciplined
- **I was left with nothing**

**The Consequences**
- Couldn't afford tuition
- UIN: Dropped out Semester 3
- Amikom: Dropped out Semester 5
- Financial disaster
- Mental breakdown #2

---

### The Pattern: Inconsistency

**The Fatal Flaw**
- Inconsistent decision-making
- Impulsive choices
- Late realizations
- Ego-driven actions
- Not thinking long-term

**The Domino Effect**
1. Wrong school choice (SMA IPS)
2. Ego-driven transfer
3. Dropout #1
4. Repeat year
5. Overconfident double degree
6. Bad company choice
7. Dropout #2 (twice)
8. Financial ruin

**The Brutal Truth**
- Not good at making money
- Not good at self-branding
- Not good at project management (for profit)
- Ignored basic needs
- Focused only on research
- Loved the craft too much
- Forgot to survive

---

### The Awakening: Subconscious Learning

**While struggling, I was learning:**

Not just technology, but life:
- Philosophy (for wisdom)
- Politics (for understanding)
- Business (for survival)
- Management (for organization)
- Finance (for stability)
- Technical depth (for mastery)

**Why polymath?**
- One fear: Don't want to destroy my future
- One goal: Be wise and comprehensive
- One drive: Never repeat mistakes

**Sounds perfectionist?**
- Yes, because of fear
- Yes, because of past failures
- Yes, because I can't afford more mistakes

---

### 2025: The Diagnosis - Understanding Myself

**ADHD - Full Diagnosis**

After years of:
- Impulsive decisions
- Inconsistent choices
- Hyperfocus on passion
- Ignoring basic needs
- Extreme curiosity
- Scattered attention
- Intense interests

**Finally understood:**
- Not just "bad at decisions"
- Not just "inconsistent"
- Not just "impulsive"
- **ADHD since childhood**

**The Pattern Makes Sense:**
- SMA IPS → IPA switch (impulsivity)
- Dropout → repeat (inconsistency)
- Double degree attempt (overconfidence)
- Hyperfocus on tech (ignoring survival)
- Polymath tendencies (scattered interests)
- Deep research (hyperfocus)
- Poor financial management (executive dysfunction)

**Diagnosed in 2025 after:**
- Years of reflection
- Deep contemplation
- Self-awareness journey
- Understanding the pattern

---

### The Spiritual Awakening: RUH, Mental, and Raga

**The Realization:**

**RUH (Soul/Spirit) - The True Self**
- Who I really am
- The consciousness
- The observer
- The decision maker

**Mental (Mind)**
- The thoughts
- The emotions
- The patterns
- **Responsibility of RUH**

**Raga (Body)**
- The physical form
- The actions
- The health
- **Responsibility of RUH**

**The Understanding:**
- RUH must be strong
- To control mental consciously
- To control raga responsibly
- To live with full awareness
- **Mental and Raga are RUH's responsibility**

**Living with Consciousness:**
- Aware of ADHD patterns
- Conscious of impulses
- Responsible for choices
- Mindful of consequences
- **RUH in control, not ADHD**

---

### The Complete Picture

**Why the mistakes?**
- ADHD impulsivity (undiagnosed)
- Lack of self-awareness (young)
- No understanding of patterns (unaware)
- RUH not yet strong (unconscious living)

**Why the persistence?**
- ADHD hyperfocus (on passion)
- Deep curiosity (ADHD trait)
- Intense interest (ADHD strength)
- Never-ending learning (ADHD drive)

**Why the struggle?**
- Executive dysfunction (ADHD)
- Poor planning (ADHD)
- Ignoring basics (hyperfocus)
- Financial chaos (ADHD challenge)

**Why still standing?**
- RUH awakening (consciousness)
- Self-awareness (reflection)
- Understanding patterns (diagnosis)
- Taking responsibility (spiritual growth)
- **RUH controlling mental and raga**
